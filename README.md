Project Description
In this project, I’ll create a music player application from scratch using Angular, the Moment.js library, and Material UI. The application will have various audio features that will enable users to play any audio file. We’ll also use dependency injection to make a few functions, like handling audio events, available throughout the project.

The music player application will give users full control over their listening experience. They will be able to play or pause a track, adjust the playback speed, move to the next or previous track, and replay a track. Additionally, users will have the option to mark tracks as favorites, making it convenient for them to find and listen to their preferred tracks easily.

Moreover, we’ll also incorporate a user-friendly slider to enable users to effortlessly drag the slider to their preferred position on the timeline and begin the track. This feature will enable precise navigation to any point within a track, ensuring a seamless experience for the users.
